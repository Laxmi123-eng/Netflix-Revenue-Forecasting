#  Netflix Quarterly Revenue Forecasting (Time Series Project)

##  Overview
I developed a **time-series forecasting model** to predict Netflixâ€™s quarterly global revenue using both historical data and regional business drivers (memberships and ARPU).  
The goal was to analyze Netflixâ€™s revenue trend, model its seasonality, and forecast future growth.

I implemented **ARIMA** and **SARIMAX (ARIMA with Exogenous Variables)** models, evaluated performance with RMSE, and extended the forecast 8 quarters into the future.  
This project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of **data cleaning â†’ model building â†’ evaluation â†’ visualization**.

##  Objectives
- Analyze quarterly Netflix revenue trends (2019â€“2024)
- Build a baseline **ARIMA(1,1,1)** model for pure trend forecasting
- Improve predictions using **SARIMAX** with membership and ARPU features
- Forecast **8 future quarters (2024â€“2026)** with uncertainty bands
- Visualize and compare model performance

---

##  Methodology
### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and formatted Netflix quarterly data
- Converted all numeric fields (revenue, members, ARPU)
- Created lag and growth rate features
- Split dataset into 80% training and 20% test periods

### 2. Modeling
- **ARIMA(1,1,1)** trained on historical revenue
- **SARIMAX(1,1,1)** trained with regional membership and ARPU
- Forecast accuracy measured via RMSE

### 3. Evaluation
| Model | RMSE (USD) | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| ARIMA(1,1,1) | â‰ˆ $661M | Baseline model |
| SARIMAX(1,1,1) | â‰ˆ $560M | Improved using exogenous data |

### 4. Extended Forecast
- Forecasted 8 future quarters (2024â€“2026)
- Added realistic business-driven variation (memberships, ARPU)
- Displayed 95% confidence intervals

##  Results & Visualization

**Legend:**
- **Gray:** Training Data  
- **Blue:** Actual Validation Revenue  
- **Red Dashed:** SARIMAX Forecast  
- **Orange Dashed:** Extended Forecast (8 Future Quarters)  
- **Shaded Areas:** 95% Confidence Intervals  

**Key Insights:**
- SARIMAX effectively captured growth driven by membership and ARPU changes.  
- Forecast indicates continued revenue growth, potentially reaching **$10â€“11B per quarter by 2026**.  
- Confidence intervals widen slightly, reflecting natural uncertainty.
